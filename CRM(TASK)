CRM Dashboard Website:
CRM?
CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. The goal of CRM is to improve customer retention, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth. 
Our task is to create a CRM model website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
Here is some feature we use in our CRM Dashboard Website.
•	Login screen:
 The login screen is typically the initial interface where users enter their credentials (such as username and password) to access the application or website.
•	Login Option:
Our website will start from a login page. If the user clicks on the Login Button, then the user will be directed to Login form. Login form will be having option to write the e-mail and password. We will give the submit button to allow us to login to our home page (Dashboard). We will also give an option for Forget password which will direct us to another Form having options to either recover password by giving more details.
•	Register Screen:
If the user clicks on the Register button, then the user will be directed to a registration form. In this form the User must provide all his information and details to make a new account. By making a new account, the user can register the website and login to the home page (Dashboard).
•	Dashboard :
The dashboard page is going to be the home page of our website. In this page, we will be showing all our basic information and updates. This page will contain all the statistical information of the website.
•	Data table:
 A data table is a tabular representation of data, typically organized into rows and columns. The left column often includes actions like adding or deleting rows, while the right column displays the data in a listing format.

•	Permission graph:
 A permission graph represents the relationships between various user roles and the permissions associated with each role. It helps administrators manage access control and define who can perform specific actions or access certain parts of the application.
•	Data table export button: 
To export data from a data table, an export button is often provided. Clicking this button allows users to download the data in a specific format, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or Excel.
•	Setting screen checkbox available: 
In the settings screen, checkboxes are a common user interface element used to enable or disable specific options or features. Users can typically select or deselect checkboxes to customize their application experience according to their preferences.
